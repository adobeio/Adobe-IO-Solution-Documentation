Adobe I/O solutions provide opportunities for partners and developers to integrate, extend, or create apps and experiences based on Adobe's products and technologies. Adobe I/O solutions demonstrate these capabilities with working use cases and documentation so that you can follow along and re-create them yourself.  

Adobe I/O services include the following:

* A central console for creating and configuring integration with Adobe products

* Accessible APIs for Adobe products

* The Runtime serverless platform, which allows you to quickly deploy custom code to respond to events and execute functions right in the cloud. Adobe I/O Runtime is built on Apache OpenWhisk, an open source project incubating at the Apache Software Foundation.
